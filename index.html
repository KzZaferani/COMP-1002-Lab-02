            <h2>How to Make Grilled Cheese</h2>
            <P>Mmm, mmm, good!</p>
            <h3>
                Ingredients you'll need:
            </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>2 pieces of bread</li>
                <li>2 pats of butter</li>
                <li>1 slice of monterey jack cheese</li>
                <li>1 slice of aged cheddar cheese</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                Process:
            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet</li>
                <li>Heat the skillet over medium heat</li>
                <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread</li>
                <li>Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the skillet</li>
                <li>Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover the entire surface area</li>
                <li>Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese</li>
                <li>Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the skillet is a golden brown)</li>
                <li>Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other side till golden brown
                    (approximately 1 to 2 minutes)</li>
                <li>Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your grilled cheese</li>

            </ol>

            <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p> Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The
                result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.</p>
            <p>Remember, Shaun says "Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!".</p>
